Using the data visualization design principles and best practices learned in Lessons 1 and 2, I will create a sketch for an alternative design. Subsequently, I will remake the original design using the ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions, and tidyverse packages to enhance its visual effectiveness and clarity."

To address this, we will standardize the y-axis across all scatterplots. By combining all subjects into one scatterplot, we’ll differentiate them not with individual titles but with a coded color scheme for the dots and lines. The y-axis labels will be unified to ‘Average Plausible Values,’ simplifying the comparison across subjects."
